We have formed the foundation of a revolutionary party. That is a prerequisite for future growth. We have established a political program and engaged in nationwide training of revolutionary cadres. We are attempting to promote Marxist theory and recognize that without revolutionary theory there can be no revolution. For the purposes of winning reforms or providing defense against ruling-class attacks on the rights and living standards of the people, it is necessary to have organization. Agitation and propaganda by themselves are completely insuﬃcient not only for the actual revolution; they are insuﬃcient for any kind of struggle that takes place in a non-revolutionary period.

Recruiting cadres and training cadres in communist agitation and propaganda, and in organization, is a complex and long term process. Learning how to enter into reformist political arenas, into the political or electoral arena, participating in the labor movement, joining spontaneous mass movements, building bridges and alliances into the working class and amongst and within oppressed communities -- these are the principle tasks of the moment. They are all complicated and require attention and constant work.

Lenin, in his writings in 1902, argued that the organization must be professional and not amateurish. The struggle for professionalism or to build an organization of professional revolutionaries was identiﬁed as the number one task when the Bolsheviks were forming as a political organization.

The PSL, too, must strive to overcome amateurism. It needs to be an organization that has professional competence. It needs leaders who have not only the ability and the desire to assume leadership -- they must be available. We encourage all of our members to make the Party a top priority in their lives and the commitment of the PSL membership is of such a high caliber that we are able to accomplish a huge amount of work given our numbers and resources. We far surpass the productivity of even well-resourced non-revolutionary organizations. But to really grow, to increase our numbers, to expand our reach, to inﬂuence a greater part of the population that is coming into political life, we must have a dedicated staﬀ of revolutionaries who are supported by the organization ﬁnancially and in other ways so that they can be fully available to provide leadership in the areas of agitation, propaganda, recruitment and organization.

The organizational tasks of this period include expanding the eﬃciency of the tactics and methods associated with the RPI framework, aggressively pursuing a recruitment and party-building strategy, engaging in a campaign to both understand and promote revolutionary theory, and to build a united front against fascism. These tasks will be addressed with other proposals and documents that will be presented at the Party Congress and then to the Party as a whole.
